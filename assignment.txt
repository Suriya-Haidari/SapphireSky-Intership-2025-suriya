1. What is the difference between var, let, and const in JavaScript?
Answer: 
var is globally scoped and can be redeclared and updated within its scope.
let is block-scoped and can be updated but not redeclared in the same scope.
const is block-scoped and cannot be updated or redeclared after its initialization.
